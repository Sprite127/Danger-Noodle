Standard-Fast mode mode - This mode is faster than normal snake. To make thiss possible i changed the "game loop speed" so it seams as tho it is fast. There is nothing out of the ordnary other than the speed. Just make sure to watch out for your tale!  


Standard-Infinite mode - Just like fast mode, it plays like regular snake except there is no end. to create this i removed the "self collision detection" so you can play forever. 

### Puzzle
